# Multiscale-Mobility-Community-COVID

This repository includes code for visualizing the community maps over the selected weeks before/during/after COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and distance distribution of movements inside the communities. 
It also includes the GeoJSON files of communities polygons at multiple scales and the timeseries of COVID-19 cases for the communities.
